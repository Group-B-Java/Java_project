Smart House: Simulation of Energy Supply and Consumption


The aim of the This project is a simulation of a Smart House system that manages energy supply and consumption using Java. The system incorporates:

1. Simulation of Smart Objects such as lights, TV, Switch and heaters.
2. Energy Sources like solar panels, Grid and batteries.
3. A Management System to control energy usage and optimize consumption.
4. A  Interface for user interaction.
5. Logging for monitoring system actions and performance.

Features

1). Device Control:
   Turn devices ON or OFF via the console.
   Monitor the energy consumption of each device.
   
2). Energy Management:
   Track energy levels in batteries.
   Simulate energy generation from solar panels.
   Distribute energy intelligently among devices.
   
3). Concurrency:
   Support for simultaneous device operation and energy updates using multithreading.
   
4). Logging:
   Logs system actions to the console and a file (log file).
   
5). Unit Testing:

   Includes unit tests to validate system functionality and exception handling.

Roles and Responsibilities
